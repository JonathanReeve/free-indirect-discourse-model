Trollope example “The Small House at Allington”

She declared to herself that time would cure Lily's wound, and that her child might yet be crowned by the bliss of a happy marriage.

She had never really liked Crosbie as a suitor, and would herself have preferred John Eames, with all the faults of his hobbledehoyhood on his head. <said who=#MrsDale discourse="free" aloud="false"> It might yet come to pass that John Eames' love might be made happy</said>.
